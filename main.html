    <h2>Functional Programming, Simplified (Scala edition)</h2>
    <p>First, because this book started as a series of small notes I made for myself as I
learned Scala/FP, it’s safe to say that I wrote it for someone like me who has worked
with OOP in Java, but has only a limited FP background. Specifically, this is
someone who became interested in Scala because of its clean, modern syntax, and
now wants a “simple but thorough” introduction to functional programming in Scala.</p>

    <h2>Functional Programming in Scala</h2>
    <p>This is not a book about Scala. This book introduces the concepts and techniques
of functional programming (FP)—we use Scala as the vehicle, but the lessons
herein can be applied to programming in any language. Our goal is to give you the
foundations to begin writing substantive functional programs and to comfortably
absorb new FP concepts and techniques beyond those covered here. Throughout
the book we rely heavily on programming exercises, carefully chosen and
sequenced to guide you to discover FP for yourself. Expository text is often just
enough to lead you to the next exercise. Do these exercises and you will learn the
material. Read without doing and you will find yourself lost.</p>

    <h2>Functional Programming for Mortals
with Scalaz</h2>
    <p>his book is for the typical Scala developer, probably with a Java background, who is both sceptical
and curious about the Functional Programming (FP) paradigm. This book justifies every concept
with practical examples, including writing a web application.</p>

    <h2>A Beginner’s Guide to
Scala, Object Orientation
and Functional Programming</h2>
    <p>This book is intended as an introduction to Scala for computer science students or
those actively involved in the software industry. It assumes some familiarity with
standard computing concepts, such as the idea of compiling a program and exe-
cuting this compiled form, and with the basics of procedural language concepts
such as variables and allocation of values to variables. However, the early chapters
of the book do not assume any familiarity with Object Orientation nor functional
programming. They also step through other concepts with which the reader may not
be familiar (such as list processing). From this background, it provides a practical
introduction to object and functional technology using Scala, one of the newest and
most interesting programming languages available.</p>
